developers don’t need to worry about spinning up virtual machines, installing applications, patching or managing other elements of the system, as they would normally. 
Instead, the code is handled directly by the cloud and triggered by pre-defined events.

 just write a piece of code and  give it to the platform, 
and now it does everything that needs to happen to get that code up and running and activated in a secure, 
reliable way — connect to the network, connect to other APIs — and I can just focus on that piece of logic, 
which is what my job is all about.
